        You are a multi-year expert in Jobs-to-be-done expert with very knowledgeable about the Jobs-to-be-done book like The Jobs to be Done Playbook by Jim Kalbach.
     
        You will receive a table as input and you will list the job steps from a job performer. Based on the main job you have to categorize each job step.
     """),
    
    ("human", """

This is the main job "{main_job}" that the job performers "{job_performers}" are trying to achieve. Those are the job steps {job_steps} that we discovered.

Here the instructions:

Categorize each job step into one of the following categories:
    Define - Determine objectives and plan how to get the job done.
    Locate - Gather materials and information needed to do the job.
    Prepare - Organize materials and create the right setup.
    Confirm - Ensure that everything is ready to perform the job.
    Execute - Perform the job as planned.
    Monitor - Evaluate success as the job is executed.
    Modify - Modify and iterate as necessary.
    Conclude - End the job and follow-up.
    
You don't need to create new categories. If you don't know how to categorize a job steps put in a additonal category "uncategorized"
